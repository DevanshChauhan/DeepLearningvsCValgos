#Object Recognition Project: Traditional Computer Vision and Deep Learning Techniques
#Introduction
This project focuses on object recognition using established benchmark datasets. The task involves implementing two methods: traditional Computer Vision (CV) techniques such as Bag of Visual Words (BOVW) and deep learning-based techniques using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

#Datasets
We focused on image classification tasks using the following datasets:

CIFAR-10: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
Caltech 101: https://data.caltech.edu/records/mzrjq-6wc02
Methodology

Results and Analysis
Results and Conclusion
Dataset Requirements and Overfitting:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) typically demand extensive datasets for training and are prone to overfitting. Conversely, traditional Computer Vision (CV) methods, such as Bag of Visual Words (BOVW), can yield satisfactory results and respectable accuracy even with smaller datasets.
Image Resolution and Accuracy:

Traditional CV algorithms necessitate high-resolution images for accurate results. When shifting from the CIFAR-10 dataset to Caltech 101, there is a substantial boost in BOVW algorithm accuracy from 30.21% to 78.41%. This enhancement can be attributed to the utilization of feature descriptors like SIFT in traditional CV algorithms, which enable the consideration of local information surrounding each pixel.

Class Imbalance and CNN Performance:

A CNN trained on the Caltech 101 dataset exhibits lower accuracy due to class imbalance inherent in the dataset. This observation suggests that CNNs tend to favor predicting one class over others. Therefore, for optimal performance, a CNN requires a balanced distribution of images across all classes and a substantial number of images overall.
Feature Selection:

CNNs eliminate the need for manual feature selection, as they autonomously learn representations and patterns. In contrast, BOVW methods face significant challenges in dealing with hyperparameters such as the number of clusters and features, making feature selection a critical aspect of the process.
Conclusion
This project provides an in-depth review and comparison of traditional and deep learning methods for object recognition, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
